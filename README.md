## Description
A library implementing ordinary differential equation (ODE) integrators. It currently implements 2 types of integrators.
The first is based on the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. The second based on the [Dormand-Prince Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand%E2%80%93Prince_method)
known in MATLABV as ode45.

## Building
This project is purely based on Rust, just need to download the compiler.

## Using the Library
The examples directory contain som examples on using the library to integrate various systems of ODE's.
